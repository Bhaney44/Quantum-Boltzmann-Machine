# Quantum-Boltzmann-Machine
This repository contains code for a Quantum Boltzmann Machine. I am working to develop the code on D-Wave's Adiabatic Quantum Computer. I posted [Issue #198](https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-hybrid/issues/198) explaining the difficulties I am currently having trying to successfully finish the project. Any thoughts, suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated.

# My goal is to implement the code from this paper:

John E. Dorband Ph.D., A Boltzmann Machine Implementation for the D-Wave (2016) https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06123.
